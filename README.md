# Sign Language to Text and Speech Conversion

## 📌 Overview
Communication is a fundamental aspect of human interaction, yet individuals with speech and hearing impairments often face challenges when communicating with the hearing population. This project, **Sign Language to Text and Speech Conversion**, aims to bridge this communication gap by translating hand gestures into corresponding **text and speech outputs** using **computer vision** and **machine learning** techniques.

The system enables real-time gesture recognition through a webcam and converts recognized sign language gestures into readable text and audible speech, promoting inclusive and accessible communication.

## ⚙️ System Architecture
1. Webcam captures hand gesture images in real time  
2. Images are processed using OpenCV  
3. Deep learning model predicts the corresponding sign  
4. Predicted sign is converted into text  
5. Text is synthesized into speech using a TTS engine

## 📌 Applications
- Assistive communication tool for deaf and mute individuals  
- Educational aid for learning and practicing sign language  
- Inclusive human–computer interaction systems  
- Accessibility solutions in public services and workplaces  
- Smart classrooms and e-learning platforms  


## 🌍 Impact
This project promotes inclusive communication by reducing barriers between sign language users and non-signers.  
By leveraging artificial intelligence and computer vision, it enhances accessibility, encourages social interaction,  
and supports educational opportunities for individuals with speech and hearing impairments.  
The system contributes toward building a more inclusive and accessible digital society.
